<h1 align="center">Welcome to TicTacToe-Minimax-AlphaBetaPruning 👋</h1>
<p>
</p>

> A tictactoe game which uses the minimax algorithm and alpa beta pruning to produce optimized moves. The game waits to be assigned a colour (&#34;blue&#34; or &#34;orange) in order to start. Blue goes first, if the program is assigned blue, it produces a move immediately and waits for orange to respond. If the program is assigned orange, it waits for the orange player to input a move using the Scanner.in.
